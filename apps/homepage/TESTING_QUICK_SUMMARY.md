# Testing Framework Quick Summary

## 🎯 What We're Testing

The testing framework is designed to verify that Lexara Engage works correctly, focusing on:

1. **Database Operations** - Making sure data is saved and retrieved correctly
2. **API Endpoints** - Verifying the registration and user management flows work
3. **Business Logic** - Ensuring validation, permissions, and multi-tenant isolation work

## 📁 Test Files Created

### Unit Tests (Isolated Function Testing)
- `tests/unit/db/db_firm.test.ts` - Tests firm CRUD operations
- `tests/unit/db/db_user.test.ts` - Tests user CRUD operations

### Integration Tests (Multiple Components)
- `tests/integration/api/firm_registration.test.ts` - Tests the complete registration flow

### Support Files
- `tests/setup.ts` - Global test configuration and mocks
- `tests/fixtures/mockData.ts` - Reusable test data
- `vitest.config.ts` - Test runner configuration
- `scripts/run-tests.sh` - Test execution script

## 🔍 What Each Test File Does

### db_firm.test.ts
Tests database operations for law firms:
- Creating a new firm
- Retrieving firm by ID
- Updating firm settings
- Listing all firms
- Deleting a firm

### db_user.test.ts
Tests database operations for users:
- Creating users within a firm
- Ensuring users can only access their own firm's data
- Managing user permissions
- Updating user information

### firm_registration.test.ts
Tests the complete registration process:
- Validates all required fields
- Checks password strength
- Creates Auth0 user account
- Creates database records
- Handles errors gracefully

## 🛠️ How to Run Tests

```bash
# From the monorepo root (/Users/shawnswaner/code/lexara/cf_version)
pnpm test --filter=homepage
```

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Test Structure** - All test files are properly organized
2. **Mock Data** - Comprehensive test data for all scenarios
3. **Test Coverage** - Critical paths are covered:
   - Firm registration
   - User management
   - Multi-tenant data isolation
   - Error handling

## ❌ What Needs Attention

1. **Dependencies** - Test runner (Vitest) needs to be installed
2. **Missing Tests** - Need tests for:
   - Conversations
   - Email notifications
   - Conflict detection
3. **E2E Tests** - Browser automation tests not yet implemented

## 🚦 Current Status

- ✅ Test framework is fully designed and implemented
- ✅ All critical test files are created
- ❌ Dependencies need to be installed to run tests
- ❌ Some feature areas still need test coverage

## 💡 Next Steps

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install` from monorepo root
2. Run tests to verify they work
3. Add missing test coverage for conversations
4. Set up E2E tests with Playwright

The testing framework follows the Software Design Document requirement that every function must be tested, with a focus on proving the code works correctly in all scenarios.
