## 1. Project Summary

Lexara Engage is a white-labeled, web-based AI application that streamlines potential client screening for law firms. Prospective clients are guided through a dynamic, AI-powered intake chatbot, while attorneys receive a secure dashboard to review responses, annotate interviews, and manage representation decisions. The application also integrates subscription-based access, attorney role management, and self-service administration.

Lexara is seeking clean, modern, and responsive UX/UI design using Tailwind CSS, with assets delivered via GitHub. A professional demo screen will also be included to support product demonstrations to law firms.

## 2. Goals

â€¢ **Client Intake Efficiency:** Make the initial intake experience smooth and professional for potential clients.  
â€¢ **Attorney Review Workflow:** Give law firms tools to efficiently evaluate leads.

â€¢ **Subscription Admin:** Support tiered pricing and firm-level account management.  
â€¢ **Sales Enablement:** Design a polished demo screen to showcase the platform.
