## System Overview

Engage is a multi-agent AI system that presents functionality and data through modern web APIs.  A companion website is also part of Engage.

A potential client is a user of the Engage application.  Initially, we will only know them by their login credentials.  They login using Auth0 OAuth2, likely via a third party IDP like Facebook or Google.

The goal of Engage is to gather information from the potential client about their legal needs with the goal of turning potential clients in to actual clients.

Engage needs to work through several tasks, usually in this order:
1- Identify the potential client.  The details available from the Auth0 login are rarely enough detail, although the email address alone may be useful in identifying existing clients.

2- Checking for conflict of interest.  Engage will have access to a table in a vector store that lists the firms existing clients and other parties where there would be a conflict of interest for the firm to represent the potential client.  If a match against the conflict list is made, Engage will end the conversation with indicating that an attorney will be in contact.  It is an optional setting that the law firm can make to allow Engage to politely decline further interaction due to a conflict of interest, without disclosing the nature of the conflict.

3- Once Engage has initial information on the potential legal matter, it performs a vector search against the Support Documents database.  This provides additional guidance and data gathering requirements.  These along with the data gathering goals supplied by the system prompt are what Engage is expected to gather from the potential client.

4- Engage continues the conversation with the potential client until all of the data gathering goals are met.  Engage then informs the potential client that an attorney from the firm will contact them within 24 hours.


Functional Details
* Engage is a web application that can be runs on our cloud environment.  Law firms can use it through a white-label configuration from our website, or they can embed Engage in their website at a sub-domain.
* The potential client is provided a link that can be used to resume the conversation if interrupted.
* If interrupted, Engage must remember and continue to conversation as it if hadn’t been interrupted.
* Engage must always be polite to the potential client.
* Engage must never indicate that there is a client-attorney privilege between the potential client and the firm using Engage.
* Engage must never offer legal advice.
* Engage must never offer medical advice.
* The potential clients almost certainly know they are interacting with an AI system.  As a result, Engage should be empathetic to the potential clients situation, but minimize interaction that is not directly related to gathering the data in the gathering goals.
* Engage is more than a data collection form, it is a conversation tool.  Nothing the restrictions and guidelines above, Engage should engage in conversation to keep the potential clients focused until all data gathering goals are satisfied.

Law Firm Functions
Each deployment of Engage supports one law firm or legal practice.  Law firms configure Engage to meet their needs by doing the following:
* Explaining their areas of practice so that Engage can understand how to shape the conversation.
* Entering restrictions on areas of law that they do not want to discuss with potential clients.  Engage will be instructed in the system prompts to politely end the conversation if the potential client seeks assistance on a matter listed in the firm restrictions.
* Adding to the Conflict Table, this is a table of people, firms, entities, etc.  It can also contain a list of lawsuits and legal actions.  This is used by Engage to attempt to detect a conflict of interest with the potential clients situation.
* Uploading Supporting Documentation to the Supporting Documents database.  These contain additional detail about the types of cases or work the firm handles, and lists additional data goals that Engage is expected to gather.  Engage uses this to enhance its conversation with the potential client and add to the data gathering goals.
* Add Guidelines.  This is a list of imperatives that the firm can add to shape the conversational functionality of Engage.  These are added to the system prompts when Engage is interacting with a potential client.

Entity Relationships
* Lexara operates Engage.
* Engage is used by law firms
* Law firms are customers of Lexara, Lexara has multiple customers.
* Law firms have one or more practice areas
* Law firms have existing and former clients, parties and counterparties in legal matters, and other firms and individuals who the law firm is unable to work with due to conflict of interest.  
* A law firm may have a conflict of interest with the user, and the user may not be aware of the conflict until detected by Engage
* Law firms who use engage share a list of potential conflicts to detect a conflict of interest.
* Law firms use Engage to interact with potential customers
* A user of engage is someone who is seeking legal help
* A user of engage is not represented by the law firm until formally engaged.
* Engage typically works with users who are not represented by the firm, but must be able to support ongoing conversations with clients of the firm.
* A user will have an identity that will be defined byAs  an email address, a phone number, an OAuth user identity, or a unique identifier provided by Engage.
* As Engage learns about the client it will associate identifying details such as email address, phone number, name, address, OAuth user identify with the Engage unique identity.

14. **Administrative portals** for both Lexara platform management and law firm configuration
15. **Audit logging** across both Durable Objects (real-time) and D1 (reporting) layers

## Hybrid Data Architecture: Durable Objects + D1

### Architecture Overview

Engage uses a **hybrid approach** that combines the strengths of Durable Objects for real-time operations with D1 for analytical queries:

**Primary Data Layer (Durable Objects)**:
- **Source of Truth**: All active legal conversations and user sessions
- **Strong Consistency**: Immediate conflict detection and audit compliance
- **Real-time Performance**: Sub-millisecond response times for live legal work
- **Geographic Distribution**: Auto-migrates to optimize user latency globally

**Query and Analytics Layer (D1)**:
- **Index Tables**: "All conversations for firm X" style queries for datagrids
- **Eventually Consistent**: Synced from Durable Objects for reporting
- **SQL Analytics**: Cross-conversation reporting and firm analytics
- **Relational Queries**: Complex joins and aggregations for legal insights

### Data Flow Strategy

```typescript
// Write Flow: DO → D1 Index
class ConversationSession {
  async addMessage(message: Message) {
    // 1. Update primary state (immediate, strongly consistent)
    this.state.messages.push(message);
    this.state.lastActivity = new Date();
    
    // 2. Update D1 indexes (async, eventually consistent)
    this.env.ctx.waitUntil(this.updateIndexes());
    
    return this.state;
  }
  
  private async updateIndexes() {
    await this.env.FIRM_INDEX_DB.prepare(`
      INSERT OR REPLACE INTO conversation_index 
      (firmId, sessionId, clientName, status, lastActivity, ...)
      VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ...)
    `).bind(/* index data */).run();
  }
}

// Read Flow: D1 for Lists, DO for Details
async function getFirmConversations(firmId: string) {
  // Fast SQL query for datagrid
  const conversations = await db.prepare(`
    SELECT sessionId, clientName, status, lastActivity
    FROM conversation_index 
    WHERE firmId = ? AND isDeleted = FALSE
    ORDER BY lastActivity DESC
  `).bind(firmId).all();
  
  return conversations; // No need to query DOs for list view
}

async function getConversationDetails(sessionId: string) {
  // Full details from Durable Object (source of truth)
  const conversation = await env.CONVERSATION_SESSION
    .get(env.CONVERSATION_SESSION.idFromName(sessionId));
  return await conversation.getState();
}
```

### D1 Index Tables for Legal Platform

The following D1 tables provide indexed access for all datagrid/list functionality:

#### **conversation_index**
```sql
CREATE TABLE conversation_index (
  firmId TEXT NOT NULL,
  sessionId TEXT NOT NULL,
  userId TEXT,
  clientName TEXT,
  clientEmail TEXT,
  practiceArea TEXT,
  status TEXT, -- 'active', 'completed', 'terminated'  
  phase TEXT,  -- 'pre_login', 'secured', etc.
  assignedTo TEXT,
  conflictStatus TEXT,
  goalsCompleted INTEGER,
  goalsTotal INTEGER,
  dataQualityScore INTEGER,
  createdAt TEXT,
  lastActivity TEXT,
  isDeleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  
  PRIMARY KEY (firmId, sessionId)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_firm_status ON conversation_index(firmId, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_firm_assigned ON conversation_index(firmId, assignedTo);
CREATE INDEX idx_firm_activity ON conversation_index(firmId, lastActivity);
```

#### **user_index**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_index (
  firmId TEXT NOT NULL,
  userId TEXT NOT NULL,
  auth0UserId TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  name TEXT,
  role TEXT,
  status TEXT, -- 'active', 'inactive', 'suspended'
  lastLogin TEXT,
  conversationCount INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  createdAt TEXT,
  
  PRIMARY KEY (firmId, userId)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_firm_role ON user_index(firmId, role);
CREATE INDEX idx_firm_email ON user_index(firmId, email);
```

#### **audit_log_index**
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_log_index (
  firmId TEXT NOT NULL,
  auditId TEXT NOT NULL,
  userId TEXT,
  action TEXT,
  resourceType TEXT,
  resourceId TEXT,
  timestamp TEXT,
  ipAddress TEXT,
  details TEXT, -- JSON blob
  
  PRIMARY KEY (firmId, auditId)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_firm_audit_time ON audit_log_index(firmId, timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_firm_audit_user ON audit_log_index(firmId, userId, timestamp);
```

### Benefits of Hybrid Approach

**✅ Best of Both Worlds**:
- **Real-time Legal Work**: Strong consistency from Durable Objects for active cases
- **Fast Analytics**: SQL queries from D1 for firm dashboards and reporting
- **Legal Compliance**: Immediate audit trails in DOs, reportable summaries in D1
- **Performance**: Hot data in DOs (milliseconds), query layer in D1 (sub-second)

**✅ Scalability**:
- **Per-Conversation Isolation**: Each legal matter scales independently
- **Firm-Wide Analytics**: D1 provides cross-conversation insights
- **Geographic Distribution**: DOs migrate globally, D1 provides consistent query performance

**✅ Data Integrity**:
- **Source of Truth**: Durable Objects maintain authoritative legal records
- **Index Consistency**: D1 indexes are eventually consistent and repairable
- **Audit Compliance**: Critical legal data never depends on eventually consistent indexes

## Durable Objects Architecture

### ConversationSession Durable Object
**Naming Convention**: `firmId:userId:sessionId`
- **sessionId**: ULID generated at session start
- **userId**: ULID generated at session start, maps to Auth0 after login
- **firmId**: Identifies the law firm instance

**Purpose**: Manages individual conversation state with security phases and resumable sessions.

**Key Features**:
- **Security Phases**: Pre-login conversation for basic assessment, then secured post-login for sensitive data
- **Resumable Sessions**: Persistent resume tokens that never expire
- **Access Control**: Once secured with Auth0 login, conversation is locked to that authenticated user
- **Conflict Caching**: Permanent conflict detection results (only cleared if firm removes conflict source)
- **Admin Deletion**: Conversations persist until explicitly deleted by lawyer/admin

**Conversation Security Flow**:
1. **Pre-login Phase** (`phase: 'pre_login'`): Anonymous conversation for user identification, conflict check, and basic legal needs assessment
2. **Login Suggestion** (`phase: 'login_suggested'`): Agent provides login link once pre-login goals completed
3. **Secured Phase** (`phase: 'secured'`): Post-authentication conversation locked to Auth0 user for detailed data gathering

**State Structure**:
```typescript
interface ConversationState {
  // Identity
  sessionId: string // ULID
  userId: string    // ULID, maps to Auth0 post-login
  firmId: string
  
  // Authentication & Security
  isAuthenticated: boolean
  auth0UserId?: string
  isSecured: boolean // true once login completed - conversation locked to auth user
  
  // Resume capability
  resumeToken: string // Persistent, never expires
  resumeUrl: string
  loginUrl?: string // Generated when agent suggests login
  
  // Pre-login goals (must complete before login suggestion)
  preLoginGoals: {
    userIdentification: boolean    // Basic name, contact info
    conflictCheck: boolean         // Initial conflict assessment
    legalNeedsAssessment: boolean  // General area of law, basic situation
  }
  
  // User identity (gathered pre-login, enhanced post-login)
  userIdentity: {
    // Pre-login (general identification)
    name?: string
    email?: string
    phone?: string
    legalArea?: string
    basicSituation?: string
    
    // Post-login (detailed personal info)
    address?: string
    detailedSituation?: string
    // Additional sensitive details gathered post-login
  }
  
  // Workflow phases
  phase: 'pre_login' | 'login_suggested' | 'secured' | 'conflict_check_complete' | 'data_gathering' | 'completed' | 'terminated'
  
  // Conflict checking (permanent once detected)
  conflictCheck: {
    status: 'pending' | 'clear' | 'conflict_detected'
    checkedAt?: Date
    conflictDetails?: string
    preLoginCheck: boolean // Basic check done pre-login
    checkedIdentity: string[] // Which identity fields were checked
  }
  
  // Data gathering
  dataGoals: DataGoal[]
  completedGoals: string[]
  supportDocuments: string[] // IDs of relevant support docs found
  
  // Conversation history
  messages: Message[]
  
  // Access control
  allowedAuth0Users: string[] // Only these users can access secured conversations
  
  // Metadata
  createdAt: Date
  lastActivity: Date
  isDeleted: boolean // For admin deletion
  deletedAt?: Date
  deletedBy?: string // Admin/lawyer who deleted
}
```

### UserIdentity Durable Object
**Naming Convention**: `firmId:userId`

**Purpose**: Aggregates user information across sessions and handles identity resolution.

**Key Features**:
- **Identity Mapping**: Maps Auth0 user to Engage userId and consolidates identifiers
- **Conflict Status**: Permanent conflict detection results cached at user level
- **Session Tracking**: Maintains history of all user sessions
- **Cross-Session Continuity**: Preserves user context across multiple conversations

**State Structure**:
```typescript
interface UserIdentityState {
  userId: string    // ULID
  firmId: string
  
  // Auth0 mapping
  auth0UserId?: string
  
  // Identity aggregation from all sessions
  identifiers: {
    emails: string[]
    phones: string[]
    names: string[]
    addresses: Address[]
  }
  
  // Conflict status (permanent until firm removes conflict source)
  conflictStatus: {
    status: 'clear' | 'conflict_detected' | 'needs_check'
    lastChecked: Date
    conflictDetails?: string
  }
  
  // Session tracking
  sessions: string[] // All sessionIds for this user
  
  // Metadata
  createdAt: Date
  lastActivity: Date
}
```

## Security Model

### Access Control Rules
- **Unsecured Conversations**: Accessible by anyone with valid `resumeToken`
- **Secured Conversations**: Only accessible if authenticated `auth0UserId` matches `allowedAuth0Users`
- **Login Transition**: Once secured with Auth0 login, conversation can never revert to unsecured state
- **Admin Override**: Law firm admins can access/delete any conversation for their firm

### Authentication Flow
1. **Session Creation**: Generate ULID `userId` and `sessionId`, create unsecured conversation
2. **Pre-login Goals**: Complete user identification, conflict check, and legal needs assessment
3. **Login Suggestion**: Agent provides Auth0 login link with deep link back to conversation
4. **Authentication**: Map `auth0UserId` to existing `userId`, secure the conversation
5. **Secured Data Gathering**: Continue with detailed personal information collection

### Conflict Detection
- **Permanent Results**: Conflict detection results never expire
- **Dual-Level Caching**: Cached at both conversation and user identity levels
- **Resolution**: Conflicts only cleared if law firm removes entry from conflict list
- **MCP Integration**: Dedicated Conflict Resolution MCP server handles all conflict checking logic

### Agent Workflow
1. **Session Creation**: Generate ULID identifiers, initialize base goals
2. **Pre-login Phase**: Gather user ID, legal needs, location + initial conflict check
3. **Goal-Driven Conversation**: Agent uses GoalTracker MCP for decision-making
4. **Adaptive Learning**: AdditionalGoals MCP searches Supporting Documents when agent detects significant new information
5. **Conflict Resolution**: ConflictChecker MCP triggers additional goals for potential conflicts (fuzzy name matches, etc.)
6. **Login Suggestion**: Agent suggests Auth0 login when critical goals complete
7. **Secured Phase**: Post-authentication detailed data gathering
8. **Completion**: Agent completes all goals, informs user attorney will contact in 24 hours

### Core Principles
- **Conservative Security**: No auto-merging identities, secured conversations locked to Auth0 user
- **Agent Autonomy**: Agent decides when to check conflicts, search for additional goals
- **Fail-Forward**: Graceful degradation if MCP services unavailable
- **Legal Compliance**: No legal/medical advice, no attorney-client privilege claims
- **Data Isolation**: Conversations stored separately from shared knowledge base
- **Goal-Driven**: Flexible conversation flow based on dynamic goal completion

### Key Features
- **Resumable Sessions**: Persistent resume tokens, conversation continuation
- **Conflict-Driven Goals**: Potential conflicts automatically add disambiguation goals
- **Firm Customization**: Supporting Documents drive agent behavior per firm
- **Multi-Session Users**: UserIdentity tracks users across multiple conversations
- **Admin Controls**: Law firm admins can delete conversations, manage conflicts
- **Permanent Conflicts**: Only human lawyers can clear conflict status

## DEPLOYMENT AND TESTING RULES

### Domain Architecture Guidelines
**NEVER test against temporary Cloudflare URLs** (*.pages.dev, *.workers.dev, etc.).

**ALWAYS use stable lexara.app domain architecture:**
- **dev.lexara.app** - Development environment
- **admin-dev.lexara.app** - Admin development  
- **test.lexara.app** - Testing environment
- **admin-test.lexara.app** - Admin testing
- **lexara.app** - Production
- **admin.lexara.app** - Admin production

### Integration Guidelines
- **Single-Domain Deployment**: ALWAYS use integrated UI/API approach to eliminate CORS issues
- **No Separate Pages**: NEVER create separate Cloudflare Pages deployments requiring cross-origin requests
- **Embedded UI**: All user interfaces should be embedded directly in Workers for same-origin serving
- **Testing**: All conversation validation and API testing must use stable domains only
